# Update the system
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Install virtualenv to create a virtual environment
sudo apt install virtualenv

# Create and activate the virtual environment
python -m venv Myenv
source Myenv/bin/activate
# Virtual environment has been activated

# Now, in the virtual environment, we need to install the required libraries:

# For MPU6050 sensor:
sudo apt install python3-smbus
pip install mpu6050-raspberrypi

# For MQ3 sensor:
sudo pip3 install RPi.GPIO

# One can configure RPi from it's PC by enabling SSH in RPi
# After enabling ssh, run following command on PC's bash, but first ensure that your RPi is connected to WiFi and get it's IP addr.

ssh pi@W.X.Y.Z

# it will ask for password, after entering correct password, you can configure your RPi.
# If your RPis and PC lie in same local network, they will function fine.
